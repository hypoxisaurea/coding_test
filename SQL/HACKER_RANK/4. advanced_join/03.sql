-- You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
-- Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

-- Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X.
-- List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

SELECT X, Y
FROM FUNCTIONS
WHERE X = Y
GROUP BY X, Y
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2

UNION

SELECT f1.X, f1.Y
FROM FUNCTIONS AS f1
INNER JOIN FUNCTIONS AS f2 ON f1.X = f2.Y AND f1.Y = f2.X
WHERE f1.X < f1.Y

ORDER BY X;
